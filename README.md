# Forseti-Public

## Forseti is a new modern moderation bot using slash commands and a unique import feature for Vortex

Forseti started as a private project for a server I am moderating in my freetime. Since my informatic studies with focus on software development I decided to make this my big private project and it's been in work for over a year now. It's certainly not perfect, but I hope that this public release will help me learning and understanding more aspect of coding and improving this bot even further! <br />

It features a unique feature that lets you import Vortex logs, though being still experimental, but working and tested on a server with over 14000 users and over 2500 punished users! <br />

The goal is to make moderating servers easier while featuring modern Discord features like slash commands, buttons and selection lists. Due to it's slash command feature it's easier than ever to use the commands, while having the versitility to moderate forum posts or threads like never before. <br />

## Why is Forseti not open source? 

Forseti is not open source yet, but I am planning to do so, though with some restrictions. Keep you eyes open in the future!
